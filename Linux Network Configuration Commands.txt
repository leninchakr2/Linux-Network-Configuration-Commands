	Show manual page for 'ip' command:
		man ip
		
	How to get help for list of possible COMMANDs for a OBJECT:
		ip OBJECT help
			Eg:	ip addr help
		
	Synopsis:
		ip [OPTIONs] OBJECT {COMMAND | help}
		
	Most frequently used OBJECTs:
		addr - Display & Modify ip addresses				{Most frequently used COMMANDs: show, add, del}
		link - Display & Modify state of network interfaces	{Most frequently used COMMANDs: show, set, add, del}
		route - Display & alter routing table
		neigh - Display & alter ARP table
		
	OBJECTs:
		addr:
			ip addr show							-	Lists network interfaces {iFace} & its ip addresses {ip/mask}
			ip -4 addr show							-	Shows ip4 version of addresses of each interfaces
			ip -6 addr show							-	Shows ip6 version of addresses of each interfaces
			ip -4 addr show dev "iFace"				-	Shows ip4 version of addresses of particular interface "iFace"
			
			sudo ip addr add "ip/mask" dev "iFace"	-	Adds an address "ip/mask" to a network interface "iFace"	{{hint: first run 'ip addr help'}}
			sudo ip addr del "ip/mask" dev "iFace"	-	Deletes an address "ip/mask" from a network interface "iFace"
			
		link:
			ip link show							-	Lists network interfaces {iFace} & its mac address
			ip link show dev "iFace"				-	Lists the network interface "iFace" & its mac address
			
			sudo ip link set dev "iFace" down		-	Sets interface "iFace" down	{{hint: first run 'ip link help'}}
			sudo ip link set dev "iFace" up			-	Sets interface "iFace" up
		
		route:
			ip route list							-	Shows,
															default 	- 	default Gateway
															Mask		- 	192.168.1.0/24
															interface	-	iFace
															ip address	-	192.168.1.3
			
	Fun fact {Try on terminal}
		ip addr show					Vs					ip link show
		{ip address is highlighted}							{mac address is highlighted}
		
		ip addr - Shows network interfaces and its ip addresses
		ip link - Shows network interfaces and its mac addresses
		
	How to get Gateway of an interface:
		ip route
		
		
DHCP client:

	sudo dhclient -v -r		-	release the ip's

	sudo dhclient -v		-	Renews dynamically assigned ip address for all network interface
	

Restarting Network:

	Best approach:	Run the generalized systemctl status command	+	Look for Correct name of network manager service

	Option 1:
				sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
	
	Option 2:
				sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

	Option 3:
				sudo service networking stop

Setting Static ip:

	install netplan package
	
	sudo dhclient -v -r
	
	sudo vim /etc/netplan/01-Network-Manager.yaml
